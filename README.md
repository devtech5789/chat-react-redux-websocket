<h2>Chat with react, redux and websocket</h2>

- clone project
- open two folders: client and server
- open two consoles in these two directories and run "npm install" - to install required packages for client      and server sides
- run script: 'npm run chat' - in client directory and 'node app' - in server's
- the window with localhost:8080 - is the view for the chat (open it in several tabs in browser to simulate       multiple users )
- enjoy :)
